# Advent of Code 2018

These are my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) solutions from 2018. I've completed all 50 puzzles, earning a total leaderboard score of 300 (not high enough to place). I've tried to clean up most of my solutions from their puzzle-winning state. Some (looking at you day 23) are not robust and most likely won't work on all inputs.
